# Image Upload to AWS S3

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a serverless image upload system using AWS services.
Users can upload images through a web interface, and the files are securely
stored in an Amazon S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs generated by AWS Lambda.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AWS S3
- AWS Lambda (Python)
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS IAM
- AWS CloudWatch

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. User selects an image from the browser.
2. API Gateway invokes a Lambda function.
3. Lambda generates a pre-signed S3 upload URL.
4. Browser uploads the image directly to S3.
5. File URL is returned and displayed to the user.

## 🔐 Security Features
- No AWS credentials exposed to frontend
- IAM roles control S3 access
- Time-limited pre-signed URLs
- Serverless architecture reduces attack surface

## 📊 Monitoring
AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor:
- Lambda execution logs
- API request errors
- Debugging and performance analysis

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Start local server:
python -m http.server 8000

2. Open browser:
http://localhost:8000/upload.html

3. Select an image and upload.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- User authentication
- Multiple file uploads
- File type & size validation
- Database integration (DynamoDB)
